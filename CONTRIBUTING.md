Explanation
-----------

Since we do not yet have a test suite, you should make sure to install
and try your patch in a various scenarios. We will also entertain a
contribution with a test case.

Consider updating `NEWS.md.in`. The topmost section is for the upcoming
release. Bugfixes should be marked with `BUGFIX`. Small things (typos,
code style) should be grouped but with multiple authors (`Documentation
updates thanks to Dan Croak and Roberto Pedroso`).

Ensure your name is in the list of contributors in `man/rcm.7`. These
are alphabetical.

Submit a pull request using GitHub. If there is a relevant bug, mention
it in the commit message (`Fixes #42.`).
